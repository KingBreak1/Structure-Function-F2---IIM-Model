This code performs a phenomenological study of deep inelastic scattering in the small Bjorken x regime using the Iancu-Itakura-Munier (IIM) model for the dipole scattering amplitude. The study focuses on the calculation of the proton structure function F2, comparing the theoretical predictions with recent HERA data.
