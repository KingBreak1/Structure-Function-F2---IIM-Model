This code calculates the structure function \( F_2 \) for virtual photon-proton interactions using a dipole model approach. Specifically, it employs the Iancu-Itakura-Munier (IIM) model for the dipole scattering amplitude. The code integrates over the transverse and longitudinal cross sections to compute \( F_2 \), comparing the results with experimental data. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code.
