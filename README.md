This code performs a phenomenological study of deep inelastic scattering in the small Bjorken x regime using the Iancu-Itakura-Munier (IIM) model for the dipole scattering amplitude. The study focuses on the calculation of the proton structure function F2, comparing the theoretical predictions with recent HERA data.

## Prerequisites

The code relies on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` 
- `scipy`
- `pandas` 
- `matplotlib`

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib
```

Make sure you have the experimental_data.xlsx file in the same directory as the script.
